# mvc-prototypal-inheritance
This is just me experimenting with using prototypal inheritance rather than the ES6 class syntax working with Model, View and Controller.

The project is not exhaustive, and it is frontend only just to experiment with some ideas. I also took a stab at using ChatGPT to help out with regular expressions and commenting. It was pretty fun!
